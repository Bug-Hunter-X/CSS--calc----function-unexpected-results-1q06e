The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit handling. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely fail because `calc()` needs units on all values.  Another common issue is using `calc()` with properties that don't accept percentages directly, causing unexpected behavior.
